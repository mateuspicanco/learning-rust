# data scientist attempts to learn Rust :crab:

As the title suggests, this repo contains my journey trying to learn Rust and figure out stuff that I could use it for in place of Python. 

One of my goals for 2023 was to learn a new programming language well and use it my day-to-day. With all the jazz surrounding Rust, I figured it would be something great to learn, as it covers pretty much anything with it comes to programming.

This repo follows the structure suggested by the [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs&t=558s) in his guide to learning Rust, which is me going over the following materials:

1. [The Rust Programming Language book (a.k.a the Rust Book)](https://github.com/rust-lang/book);
   - [And Brown University's version with interactive quizzes](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu);
2. [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/);
3. [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings);

The repo will also host my notes and the small projects I plan to do along the way.
